    "# Naruhodo Podcast Graph Analyzer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naruhodo** is a Brazilian podcast dedicated to answering listeners’ questions about science, common sense, and curiosities. Every episode is packed with science-based content and is enriched with a diverse set of references—ranging from scientific papers and articles to books and online resources. Many episodes share overlapping themes and often reference the same sources, which makes the dataset ideal for creating an interconnected graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on scraping the available Naruhodo podcast data and importing it into Neo4j. The primary objective here is to efficiently collect and structure the data into a graph database, establishing a robust foundation. Future projects will build upon this groundwork to reveal connections between episodes, identify clusters of related themes, and explore how references bridge multiple subjects.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "*Naruhodo* is not only a podcast—it’s a curated collection of scientific exploration where episodes often intersect through shared references. **The primary goal of this notebook is to scrape the available Naruhodo podcast data and import it into Neo4j, creating a robust graph database foundation.** Further projects utilizing this dataset will be developed in separate notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This foundational project opens up a wide range of future possibilities, especially with the integration of LLMs and Machine Learning. Here are the top 5 potential projects that can be pursued once the data is in Neo4j:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Podcast Summaries:**  \n",
    "   Combine large language models (LLMs) with data retrieval from Neo4j to generate insightful episode summaries or answer user queries by referencing related content.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **RAG-Graph for Thematic Exploration:**  \n",
    "   Integrate RAG techniques with graph-based search methods to offer context-aware, detailed insights into episodes. This approach can help users navigate complex scientific topics by linking episodes and references seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Episode Clusterization and Recommendation Systems:**  \n",
    "   Apply clustering algorithms on the graph data to identify groups of episodes that share common themes or references. This can power personalized recommendation systems, suggesting episodes similar to those users already enjoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pathway Discovery for Thematic Learning:**  \n",
    "   Leverage graph analytics to map out learning pathways. For example, if a user is interested in the theme of behavior, the system can highlight a sequential pathway through episodes and references that deepen their understanding of the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge Mapping:**  \n",
    "   Analyze the intersections of various scientific disciplines across episodes by examining shared references. This can uncover hidden relationships and provide insights into how different fields influence each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections explain how the data is scraped, normalized, and imported into Neo4j, setting the stage for these advanced analyses and applications in future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details about the podcast and its themes, you can check out [Naruhodo on B9](https://www.b9.com.br/shows/naruhodo/)."

    "## Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The repository is organized into the following modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Environment Configuration:**  \n",
    "  Stores all sensitive connection details (such as Neo4j credentials and file paths) in a `.env` file using `python-dotenv`. This keeps your configuration secure and separate from the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Scraping Module:**  \n",
    "  Contains functions that send HTTP requests, parse HTML content, and extract references from individual podcast posts. This module forms the foundation for gathering raw data from the Naruhodo website.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Collection and CSV Generation:**  \n",
    "  Iterates over multiple search result pages to collect all podcast post URLs and then scrapes each post for its references. The collected data is saved as a ragged CSV file, where each row contains the episode URL followed by a variable number of reference strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CSV Normalization:**  \n",
    "  Converts the ragged CSV into a normalized CSV format. In the normalized file, each row represents a single relationship between an episode and one reference, making the data ideal for graph import and subsequent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Neo4j Data Import:**  \n",
    "  Loads the normalized CSV file and builds the graph in Neo4j by creating nodes for episodes and references, and establishing `:REFERENCES` relationships between them. This module lays the groundwork for future graph-based analyses and applications.\n"

    "This project showcases a complete pipeline for extracting, normalizing, and importing podcast episode data into a Neo4j graph database. By leveraging environment configuration, data normalization, and robust Neo4j import techniques, you can reveal the hidden connections between episodes and references. This approach not only demonstrates technical proficiency in Python and graph databases but also opens up many avenues for sophisticated data analysis—making it an excellent addition to your portfolio.\n",
